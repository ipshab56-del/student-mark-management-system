## Summary
Successfully replaced all Tailwind CSS classes with pure CSS equivalents while maintaining the same design. All management pages (students, teachers, marks, fees) now have consistent layouts with form sections taking 40% width and table sections taking 60% width. The application now uses custom CSS classes that replicate Tailwind functionality, reducing complexity and dependencies. Form and table containers are now transparent to show the background image. The server is running at http://localhost:8000 for testing.
